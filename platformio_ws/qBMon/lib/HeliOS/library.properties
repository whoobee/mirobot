sentence=The free embedded operating system.
paragraph=HeliOS is an embedded operating system that is free for anyone to use. While called an operating system for simplicity, HeliOS is better described as a multitasking kernel for embedded systems. HeliOS is very small. In fact, it is small enough to run on most 8-bit microcontrollers including the popular AVR based Arduino Uno. Written entirely in C, HeliOS runs on a variety of microcontrollers and integrates easily into any project. HeliOS is also easy to learn with an Application Programming Interface (API) consisting of only 21 function calls.
